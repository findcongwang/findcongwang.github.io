A technical trader uses charts and indicators to interpret market movements, assuming that the price of the underlying security "prices-in" news items. Thus it was natural to learn the ropes and get familiar with the tools I'll be using for trading.

I found this really nice resource called [Chart School](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school), courtesy of StockChart.com. Decided to just jump in and read all of the overview, indicators, and overlays articles, getting a board picture without going too deeply.

In my reading exercises, I found many systems of trading and interpretations of the same technical indicators. Mostly importantly, the article on [Multicollinearity](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:multicollinearity) which advises on how to build your own trading system using indicators.
