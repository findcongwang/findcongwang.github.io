      Waterloo Computer Science graduate, I took the entrepreneurial track back in school and ran several startup ventures back in those days like many classmates. Some wanted to advance the world into a new age, some wanted to save the world, and some wanted to make billions. There was a time that I bold dreams too. Nowadays I don't know anymore, I probably fell into third category somewhere along the way (not that there's anything wrong with that).

      Always had an interest in creating content, I tried shout-casting e-sports back in high school. Although my poor English skills made the whole ordeal embarrassing to think about even today. Tried blogging about entrepreneurship in 2016 while I was doing Innovation Consulting as a content marketing strategy, and it turned out I wasn't a good writer either. Although this time around my years of running startups have made me more or less resistant to embarrassment.

      This time around I'll just blog about whatever I am doing whenever I feel like it. My last blog's about me section famously had in its "about the author" section:
      <blockquote cite="http://toppiqshq.com/about.html">
        Cong Wang is an Innovation Consultant and Entrepreneur based in Ontario. He will complete a bio #soon.
      </blockquote>
      It only took a full year.

      Not a big fan of lists since they never get completed, but here's the type of content I want to be making.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developer diary type of posts about my side projects, currently about stock trading</li>
      <li>Articles summarizing some of my readings and how they can relate to my interests</li>
      <li>Audio recordings of random book chapters or things I read, there was a time I wanted to record audio books</li>
      <li>Song covers, maybe. If you see these I highly suggest that you reconsider before subjugating yourself under such torment</li>
      <li>Videos, same content as audio stuff but with either some slideshow for context, or with my face</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Third time is the charm, right?</p>
